Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [How to Replace React Components With PureScript's React Libraries](https://thomashoneyman.com/articles/replace-react-components-with-purescript/) by Thomas Honeyman

    >  PureScript helps reduce bugs and improve the stability of complex applications. Learn how to incrementally take over a small React application using Purescript's React and React Basic libraries while writing idiomatic code in both languages.

## Jobs

<!-- keep through July 18 -->
-   [Galois is hiring for a variety of roles](https://galois.com/careers/) (ad)

    > Including but not limited to: Software Engineers/Researchers, Project Managers, Hardware Engineers, Software Integration Engineer.
    >
    > We collaborate with organizations like NASA, DARPA, and AWS to explore blue sky ideas and turn them into usable technology. Some of the things we've worked on in the past: Formal methods, static analysis, cryptographic algorithms, abstract interpretation, type theory, formal verification, reinforcement learning, autonomous systems assurance, communication security, cyber-deception for network defense, DDoS defense, provable hardware security, and statistical anomaly detection for detecting advanced persistent threats. We think working here is awesome; see [lifeatgalois.com](https://lifeatgalois.com).

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [eventlog2html](https://mpickering.github.io/eventlog2html/), a tool for creating interactive visualisations of eventlogs. In particular, it creates interactive charts from the heap profiling events.
