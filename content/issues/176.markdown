    > I recently released version 0.6 of the composite library on GitHub! Itâ€™s been a few years since the last release, so the code had stagnated quite a bit.

    > Some years ago there was an unfinished GraphQL implementation. The project was on hold for the last few years. Recently I took over the maintenance to continue the development.
