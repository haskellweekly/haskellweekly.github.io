## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [`ghc-source-gen`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-source-gen-0.1.0.0), a library for generating Haskell source code. It uses the `ghc` library to support recent language extensions, and provides a simple, consistent interface across several major versions of GHC.
