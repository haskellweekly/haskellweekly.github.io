<h2>Advertising</h2>

<p>
  You can advertise with Haskell Weekly by purchasing a sponsored link.
  Sponsored links are similar to featured links except that they say "(ad)" after the title.
  Here's an example of how they look:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href>Reach an engaged audience by advertising with Haskell Weekly!</a>
      (ad)
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        and the average click rate was 23%.
      </p>

  </li>
</ul>

</p>
